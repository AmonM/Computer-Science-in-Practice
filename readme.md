# Computer Science in Practice

This repository contains my code from Algator project which can be found on [this link](https://github.com/ALGatorDevel/ALGatorWeb).

I've also included instructions in Slovenian language on how to integrate it into older versions of Algator. 

I will try to include English version of instructions in the future.
